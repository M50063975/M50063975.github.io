      <td><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
        This article from the American Society of Neuroimaging gives an overview of the different brain imaging technologies used in clinical and research settings. It explains how imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT help visualize the brain's structure and activity, making it possible to diagnose and monitor neurological and psychological conditions. The page highlights how each method works and their advantages or limitations. For example, MRI provides detailed structural information, while PET scans are better at detecting brain activity and function. The resource is designed for medical professionals, but it's still accessible to general readers who want to learn how technology contributes to brain health. Overall, it emphasizes the importance of neuroimaging in both diagnosing conditions and conducting research on brain function and disorders.

        This Psych Central article explains various types of brain imaging techniques and how they're used to study and treat mental health conditions. It describes technologies like fMRI, CT scans, and EEGs, and explains what each one measures — such as brain structure, blood flow, or electrical activity. The article also talks about when doctors might use each scan, like diagnosing depression, ADHD, or epilepsy. It's written in a very clear, beginner-friendly way, which makes it a good introduction for students or anyone curious about the topic. The summary at the end of the page also compares the strengths and weaknesses of each method, which helps readers understand why multiple tools are often used together.
